        In 2005 the Health Select Committee investigated the pharmaceutical industry and recommended that the GMC set up a statutory register of doctors interests.

        This hasn’t happened. We continue to campaign for a central, statutory register, but in the meantime, we offer this site for doctors to make voluntary declarations of interest.

      <h2>Why is this important? </h2>

      <p>Doctors may receive money and benefits from a wide range of sources. They are paid for their direct services to NHS patients from the NHS (sometimes via intermediaries). They may be paid by other employers, or insurers or directly by private patients. Because of their skills and reputations, they may be paid to give expert advice to other NHS bodies, to lawyers and regulators, and to commercial companies outside their main job. They may make fees and royalties from lectures, media work and writing. On top of this, they may be paid by the pharmaceutical industry to give lectures to other doctors.. They may run companies that sell health services to the NHS. They may receive hospitality, such as food and drink, or accept free travel and hotel accommodation from industry in order to attend conferences. They may accept free training about which treatments work best, that has been funded by drug companies. They may be paid by industry to conduct research. They may be paid by PR companies working on behalf of drug companies, or providers of health services, such a companies making supplements, health products, or foods.

      It can be hard to determine what a 'conflict' is, and of course what is a conflict in one context might not be a conflict in another. This is why we describe this site for 'declarations of interest' as we believe this will support transparency and judgements about the potential biases individuals may have.
      </p>

      <p>
      We suggest that headlines of: clinical work, academic work, consultancy, financial interests, sponsorship received (including educational) , political and spousal interests are useful but if you have other suggestions please let us know.

        It's not necessarily a bad thing if doctors are paid for their time and expertise working outwith the NHS. For example, working for NICE, or giving expert views to a court. However, when a doctor has a financial “conflict of interest”, this can
        <a title="Spurling 2010 review" href="http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1000352" target="_blank">affect the treatment decisions they make, or recommend</a>.
        These conflicts cannot be entirely avoided, and in many cases they are entirely reasonable. However, it is important that information is available on which companies have paid a doctor, so that colleagues and patients can decide for themselves what they think. For example, there is longstanding evidence that
        <a title="Spurling 2010 review" href="http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1000352" target="_blank">exposure to industry promotional activity can lead to doctors recommending worse treatments for patients

        Today, it’s very hard to find out who has paid a doctor in the UK. We know that the pharmaceutical industry has paid healthcare workers £millions  in the UK - in excess of £50 million in 2015.
        But doctors
        <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/8/10/e023094" target="_blank">don’t always declare this</a>. Employers and regulators have failed to collect this important information. Where data has been collected, at public expense, this is often kept secret from patients and researchers. The small amount of publicly accessible information is chaotic and dispersed across multiple websites, or not at all. Nor is this just about the pharmaceutical industry.
        A <a href="https://chpi.org.uk/papers/reports/pounds-for-patients-how-the-private-hospital-sector-uses-financial-incentives-to-win-the-business-of-medical-consultants" target="_blank">report in 2018</a> showed that some consultants have undeclared interests in private hospitals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Professional bodies, regulators, hospitals, and other NHS organisations have failed to address this problem, despite many decades of research and campaigning. This site is the beginning of an attempt to bring transparency.
